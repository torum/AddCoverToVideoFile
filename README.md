# AddCoverToVideoFile
A cross-platform desktop GUI app to easily add cover art/thumbnail to MP4 and MKV files.  

This app is developed as an [Avalonia UI](https://avaloniaui.net/) app and uses [Taglib#](https://github.com/mono/taglib-sharp) for metadata tag editing, so it should run and work on Windows, ~~Linux~~, and Mac as well using .NET runtime. 

However, it turnes out [Avalonia UI currently does not support file drag and drop on Linux](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia/issues/6085) ... so it runs fine but it does not accept file drop on Linux... sad.
